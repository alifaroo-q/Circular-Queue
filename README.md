# Circular-Queue
a c++ implementation of circular queue

Circular Queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called ‘Ring Buffer’. 

# Time Complexity:
Time complexity of enQueue(), deQueue() operation is O(1) as there is no loop in any of the operation.
